In June's annual meeting of the steering committee, [Paul Keller](https://www.kl.nl/en/people/paul-keller/) - on behalf of [Europeana Foundation](https://pro.europeana.eu/) - was elected chair of the consortium.  Paul is the Director of Dutch think tank Kennisland, and a member of the Europeana Foundation, and Network Association Governing Boards.

The renewal of consortium chair follows the departure of co-founder [Jill Cousins](https://pro.europeana.eu/person/jill-cousins). Paul is supported in his role by  Vice-Chair, Caitlin Horrall of [Library & Archives Canada](https://nhds.ca/).   

We'd like to thank Jill - and fellow co-founder and ex-chair of the DPLA, [Dan Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Cohen_(academic)) for their work in creating the vision for the consortium, and starting us on the path towards becoming a firmly established global standard in the cultural heritage sector.

In addition, in July [Greg Cram](https://twitter.com/GregCram) was been elected co-chair of the Statements Working Group.  Greg is the Associate Director of Copyright and Information Policy for the [NYPL](https://t.co/odtspoGmpH), involved in the development of the consortium since its inception and is a keen advocate for the take up on statements.  

The position of co-chair of the Statement Working Group was previously held by Paul Keller, alongside current co-chair Emily Gore.
